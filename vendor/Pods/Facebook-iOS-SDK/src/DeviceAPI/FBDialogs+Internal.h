 @param params Params for the native Login dialog

 @param clientState An NSDictionary that's passed through when the completion handler
 is called. This is useful for the app to maintain state. May be nil.

 @param handler A completion handler that may be called when the login is
 complete. May be nil. If non-nil, the handler will always be called asynchronously.

 @return An FBAppCall object that will also be passed into the provided
 FBAppCallCompletionHandler.

 @discussion A non-nil FBAppCall object is only returned if the corresponding
 canPresentFBLoginDialogWithParams method is also returning YES for the same params.
